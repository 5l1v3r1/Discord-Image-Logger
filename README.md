# Discord-Image-Logger
A python logger you can use to log anyone with a image. It also logs the ip just from the Image.


# HowToUse
Download the files and run it on your system, by running setup.bat and then once the requirements have been installed. Run the run.bat and and it will start this will then run the image link and embed to log someone with an ip 


# Note
This tool demonstrates and makes it easy for people to one click and log you, also stop falling for the scams of a one click image logger where you drag a image from ur desktop to discord and it logs your cookies, those are all fake and try to rip you off as they sell for like $10 - 30 bucks and they would just block you. This community is like this so make sure that to prevent getting scammed and having real tools like this virus check it first using ilspy or something and decompile if its ok and also check the code before running . Only use this on your own PC and do not use it for a bad malicious intent otherwise you could get in trouble and i am not responsible for any damages. This might be the cloest one click method or image logge to steal 9 year olds stuff.
